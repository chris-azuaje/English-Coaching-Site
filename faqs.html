          <h3>What age groups and levels do you teach?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              I specialize in teaching students of all age groups, from young
              children to adults. My teaching covers a wide range of levels,
              from beginners who are just starting to learn English, to advanced
              learners looking to refine their fluency and grasp of complex
              grammatical structures. Each lesson is tailored to meet the
              specific needs and goals of the student.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>How do you personalize your tutoring for each student?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              I begin with an initial assessment to understand each student's
              current level of English, learning style, and objectives. Based on
              this assessment, I create a personalized learning plan that
              targets the student's specific areas for improvement, whether
              that's expanding vocabulary, mastering grammar, improving
              pronunciation, or enhancing conversational skills. I also
              incorporate interests and hobbies into lessons to make learning
              engaging and relevant.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>What materials and methods do you use in your teaching?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              I use a variety of materials and methods in my teaching, including
              textbooks, online resources, multimedia content, and practical
              exercises. I focus on a balanced approach that includes reading,
              writing, speaking, and listening skills. Interactive activities,
              such as role-plays, discussions, and storytelling, are key
              components of my teaching method to ensure lessons are engaging
              and effective.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>How do you track and assess progress?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Progress is assessed continuously through observation during
              lessons, regular quizzes, and assignments. I provide constructive
              feedback on all work done by the student and conduct formal
              assessments at regular intervals to track improvement and adjust
              the learning plan as needed. Students and parents (for younger
              learners) receive regular progress reports detailing achievements
              and areas for further development.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              I understand that unexpected events can occur, leading to the need
              to reschedule or cancel a lesson. I kindly request at least 24
              hours' notice for cancellations or rescheduling. For cancellations
              made with less than 24 hours' notice, unless due to emergency
              situations, a cancellation fee may apply. This policy helps manage
              scheduling and ensures that I can offer the missed time slot to
              other students.
